# Getting Started with AI Recruiting: A Complete Guide

The recruiting industry is undergoing a massive transformation. With the rise of AI-powered digital workers, recruiting agencies can now automate time-consuming tasks and focus on what they do best: building relationships and making great matches.

## What Are AI Digital Workers?

AI digital workers are specialized AI agents designed to handle specific tasks in your recruiting workflow. Unlike general-purpose AI tools, these workers are trained specifically for recruiting tasks like:

- **Lead generation and qualification**
- **Candidate outreach and engagement**
- **Initial phone screening**
- **Interview scheduling**
- **Follow-up automation**

## The Benefits of AI in Recruiting

### 1. Scale Without Sacrificing Quality

Traditional recruiting requires a linear relationship between headcount and capacity. With AI digital workers, you can handle 3x more candidates without hiring additional staff.

### 2. 24/7 Operations

Your AI workers never sleep. They can engage with candidates across time zones, ensuring no opportunity is missed.

### 3. Consistent Performance

AI workers deliver consistent results every time. No bad days, no sick leave, no vacation time.

## Getting Started: Your First AI Worker

The easiest way to get started is with an AI SDR (Sales Development Representative) like Alice. Here's how:

1. **Define your ideal candidate profile**
2. **Set up your outreach sequences**
3. **Connect your CRM and email tools**
4. **Launch and monitor performance**

## Common Concerns and How to Address Them

### "Will AI replace human recruiters?"

No. AI digital workers handle the repetitive tasks so human recruiters can focus on relationship building, complex negotiations, and strategic decisions.

### "What about the personal touch?"

AI workers are designed to enhance, not replace, human interaction. They handle the initial touchpoints and qualification, then hand off qualified candidates to human recruiters.
